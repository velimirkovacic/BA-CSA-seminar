abstract="Metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization, firefly algorithm and harmony search are now becoming powerful methods for solving many tough optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a new metaheuristic method, the Bat Algorithm, based on the echolocation behaviour of bats. We also intend to combine the advantages of existing algorithms into the new bat algorithm. After a detailed formulation and explanation of its implementation, we will then compare the proposed algorithm with other existing algorithms, including genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm seems much superior to other algorithms, and further studies are also discussed.",

    abstract = { Optimal utilization of water resources by means of water transfers and reservoirs in semiarid and arid regions is used to mitigate natural water scarcity. In this context, metaheuristic algorithms for optimum reservoir system operation have become an attractive alternative to traditional operations research algorithms such as linear programming (LP), nonlinear programming (NLP), and dynamic programming (DP). This paper presents the metaheuristic bat algorithm (BA) and its application to the optimal operation of the Karoun-4 reservoir system in Iran and to a hypothetical four-reservoir system. The merits of the performance of the BA in the optimization of reservoir operation are demonstrated by comparison to those of LP, NLP, and genetic algorithm (GA) in terms of the convergence to global optima and of the variance of results about global optima for reservoir optimization problems. }

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for damage detection in structures by applying a flexible combination based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and cuckoo search (CS) algorithm. ANN has become one of the most powerful tools employing computational intelligence techniques to tackle complex problems in numerous fields. However, due to the application of backpropagation algorithms based on gradient descent, a major drawback of ANN is the common problem of local minima that acts as a great hindrance to the search for the best solution. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose to combine ANN with evolutionary algorithms based on global search techniques. This paper employs CS to improve ANN training parameters (weight and bias) by minimizing the difference between real and desired outputs and then using these parameters to generate the network. Two numerical models, comprising a steel beam calibrated using experimental measurements and a large-scale truss bridge, are used to assess the robustness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that ANN combined with CS (ANN-CS) is accurate and requires a lower computational time than ANN, and evolutionary algorithm (EA) alone in terms of structural damage localization and quantification.}
